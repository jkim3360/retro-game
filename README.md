I plan to build a platformer side-scrolling game that requires the user to dodge incoming objects. Firby, the mysterious pink round creature, is desperate to get home after a long day at the office. His boss threw him under the bus by piling work on him last-minute and his herniated disc is acting up. Drat! 

The objective of this game is to survive the flight home without getting hit by hostile objects such as absurd political rhetoric, a rogue Super Mario star, and the legendary Excalibur flying back home like Thor's hammer.
