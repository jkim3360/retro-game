# The game

I built a side-scrolling platformer in homage to a collection of video games that captivated the imaginations of young boys and girls of a special generation before the advent of life-devouring smartphones. This is a very simple game built by a two-week old developer, so please bear with any bugs. This game requires the player to dodge incoming objects lest you die. In the game, of course. 

Dodger, the mysterious, adorable, roly-poly-esque bundle of delight, is desperate to get home after a long day at the office. His boss threw him under the bus by piling work on him last-minute and his herniated disc is acting up. Drat!

# How to play

The objective of this game is to survive the flight home without getting hit by hostile objects such as absurd political rhetoric, a rogue Super Mario star, and the legendary Excalibur flying back home like Thor's hammer. Use the mouse and click and move your character. This game is all about timing your click perfectly, because there is a slight lag in your character's movement. Watch out for the occasional hearts! They replenish your health bar, located at the top left of the window. The player who lasts longest wins!
